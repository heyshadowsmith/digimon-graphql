    description: `A Dinosaur Digimon whose cranial skin has hardened so that it is covered in a rhinoceros beetle-like shell. It is an extremely aggressive Digimon, with a body like a lethal weapon covered in sharp claws and gigantic horns. However, it is highly intelligent, and if you're able to tame it then there probably isn't any monster as strong. Its Special Move "Mega Flame" is spewing extremely high-temperature flames from its mouth and reducing everything to ashes.`,

    description: `A unique Digimon that is conjectured to be a subspecies of Greymon. Its entire body as well as the carapace on its head have also developed to become like lethal weapons, giving it a more aggressives appearance. Its Special Move "Mega Flame" is spewing ultra-high-temperature flames from its mouth and reducing everything to ashes. Also, it fires its "Mega Burst", which has the explosive power of "Mega Flame" enhanced to its limit within its mouth. Furthermore, its "Horn Impulse", in which it charges with its gigantic horns and pulverizes the opponent, is also a powerful attack.`,

    description: `A Digimon that resembles an ancient dinosaur that existed in the prehistoric world. It sweeps everything away with its two well-developed arms and its gigantic tail. It is extremely easy to tame due to its intelligence and docile personality. For that reason, it is highly valued by beginner Tamers, and is often raised with care. You could probably say that it is a representative figure of the most basic Digimon. Its Special Move is spewing out deep crimson flames the same color as its body.`,

While it has been called a 'feral Greymon', befitting its more violent disposition, it is in no way a lone wolf and possesses enough intelligence to work together with its allies as a team. Its Special Move is a blast of high-temperature flames spewed from its mouth.`,

    description: `A Dinosaur Digimon whose body was corroded by a vicious computer virus. Although it was originally a Tyranomon-species Digimon, it was infected by a vicious computer virus, causing a bug in its flesh's configuration data and transforming it into a frenzied Digimon. Its body turned black, its arms grew sturdier than Tyranomon's, and its offensive power grew. It identifies anything reflected in its eyes as an enemy and starts attacking, becoming completely frenzied. With its Special Move "Fire Blast", a super-powerful jet of flames, it transforms all of its surroundings into a sea of flames.`,
