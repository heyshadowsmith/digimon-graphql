    description: 'A Reptile Digimon with an appearance resembling a small dinosaur, it has grown and become able to walk on two legs. Its strength is weak as it is still in the process of growing, but it has a fearless and rather ferocious personality. Hard, sharp claws grow from both its hands and feet, and their power is displayed in battle. It also foreshadows an evolution into a great and powerful Digimon. Its Special Move is spitting a fiery breath from its mouth to attack the opponent.',

    description: `Black Agumon is a Reptile Digimon. It has grown up and become able to walk on two legs, and has an appearance like a tiny dinosaur. Because it is still on the way to adulthood, its power is low, but as its personality is quite ferocious, it doesn't understand fear. It has grown hard, sharp claws on its hands and feet, and demonstrates its power in battle. It is also a being that foretells digivolution to a great and powerful Digimon.`,

    description: `A rare species of Digimon that looks exactly like Betamon. It is proud of the fact that unlike Betamon, who only utilises electric attacks, it is capable of controlling water as well, even if only a little. Its personality is similar to Betamon's, preferring to silently remain in quiet places. Its Special Move is erecting a large pillar of water that sends enemies flying.`,
