    description: `A Cyborg Digimon which has mechanized more than half of its body. The Metal Greymon of File Island were able to drastically extend their vital functions through remodeling, but their flesh portions could not hold out and were discolored blue. However, perfect Metal Greymon are Cyborg Digimon that succeed in evolving from Greymon, and draw out a stronger power. In order to evolve to Metal Greymon, it must fight its way through and defeat the formidable opponents who come against it. Also, Metal Greymon's offensive power is said to equal that of a single nuclear warhead, and if the likes of a low-level Digimon suffered that blow, it would be annihilated without leaving a trace. Its Special Moves are its "Trident Arm" made from enhanced Chrome Digizoid, and firing its "Giga Destroyer" organic missiles from the hatch on its chest.`,
